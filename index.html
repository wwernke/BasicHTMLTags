    <h1>Here we have a header</h1>

    <h3>After this we have some interesting text</h3>
    <p>Sometimes we can't think of things to write so we just ramble on like lorem ipsum.</p>

    <br />
    <P>Other times we take a long paragraph and share that we are working late into the night to complete this assignment,
     but are having such a great time doing it.  However, we have now lost track of time.
    </P>

    <h3>Then we write a list of a few things we might need to stay awake tonight.</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Hot Tea</li>
    <li>Potato Chips</li>
    <li>Pretzels</li>

    <hr />

    <p>Then we have some more text showing we understand how horizontal line breaks work.</p>

    <h3>Check it out! Clearly, Brownie has figured out I will need a cup!</h3>
