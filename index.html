<h3>Late Night Coding</h3>
    <p>Sometimes when a lot of us are coding at night we really can't think of anything to write to fill up the paragraph so we try and use some filler text called lorem ipsum. VS Code makes it so easy! I will certainly be using it more in the future. 
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Nulla, minima eum, illo saepe consectetur quis eveniet aliquid quasi unde at officiis possimus, provident itaque officia velit ab libero accusamus sequi. That helps make the paragraph a nice solid block of text on the page.</p>
    <br />
    <P>The next thing I just did was create a line break. I'm working pretty late into the evening to complete this assignment, but having such a great time doing it, I'm definitely unaware of the time.</P>

    <h3>When coding tonight, here's a little list of things that I might need to help me stay awake.</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Hot Tea</li>
    <li>Potato Chips</li>
    <li>Pretzels</li>
    </ol>

<p>Then I want to show off how a few horizontal line breaks can work great on the page.</p>

<h3>Check it out! Clearly, Brownie has figured out I will need a bigger cup to hold my tea this evening!</h3>
